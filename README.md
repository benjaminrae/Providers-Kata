# Providers Kata

The idea is to refactor the code following the tasks in `EventService.test.ts`.

By the end all tests should always pass and there should be no usage of `expect.any(...)`

## Getting Started

Make sure you fetch the git tags and install the dependencies:

```bash
git fetch --tags
pnpm install
git checkout start
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Running Tests in Watch Mode

```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

## Seeing the Proposed Solution

```bash
git checkout solution
```
